# Meta Privacy ðŸ’Œ

Meta Privacy is a concept with 2 objectives, one short term and one long term

## Before, The problem

The cookie banners, the RGPD modal for Europeans and the difficulty for Internet users to read and understand how the data will be used are problems.

It is very painful in 2021 to browse the internet.

Setting up a GDPR modal is also a very boring task for developers and webmasters alike.

## The solution

The solution is to create a standard like the one Apple has imposed in its Apple store.

A modal that goes to the essentials with the data collected, cookies etc ... without justification.

### But why without justification?

The receipts are just marketing texts, nobody really reads them and then if you use a service like Zoom, you know why the site will collect data from your camera.

this will allow sites not to be too greedy on certain data which is very far from essential.

## Short term

in the short term, the script will inject a universal modal using specific meta tags as well as attributes on your script elements.

You can also define "requirements" to prohibit the deactivation of certain data and therefore force its activation.

However, the user will be informed and therefore everyone will find their account.

The scripts will therefore only be injected once the user has validated their choice of data.

## Long term

in the long term, browsers like Bravo and Firefox will be the first to integrate functionality similar to the meta privacy javascript script.

While reusing the same tags and same events in order to keep a certain backward compatibility with the script and therefore do not require any additional programming.

The parameters could be shared between the websites by activating for example the analytics for all the websites and therefore not displaying a modal if the website meets all the default conditions of the user.
